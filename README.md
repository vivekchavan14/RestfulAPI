# User Management App with Express.js

This is a simple user management application built using Express.js, demonstrating basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for user data.

## Features

- List all users
- Create a new user
- Retrieve a user by ID
- Update user information
- Delete a user

## API Endpoints
- GET /users: Get a list of all users.
- POST /api/users: Create a new user.
- GET /api/users/: id: Retrieve a user by ID.
- PATCH /api/users/: id: Update user information.
- DELETE /api/users/: id: Delete a user.

## Data Storage
User data is stored in the MOCK_DATA.json file. This is a simple demonstration; in a production scenario, you'd likely use a database.
